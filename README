This is a simple OpenGL ES app for the iPhone that can render .h models. Included are a truncated icosahedron (soccer ball), a regular icosahedron, and a tetrahedron. There is simple lighting and coloring are used. There is no texturing, it will be coming soon!

There is no attribution required but is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for downloading,
